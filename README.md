# Chatbot Using NLP

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a **Chatbot** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The chatbot is designed to understand simple user inputs and respond based on predefined intents such as greetings, weather-related queries, and jokes. The project is developed using **Python**, **Flask**, **NLTK**, and **Spacy** for NLP tasks.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used for the chatbot.
- **Flask**: Web framework used for building the web interface.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text preprocessing and basic NLP tasks (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- **Spacy**: For advanced NLP tasks like part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the chatbot web interface styling.
