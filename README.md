# Chatbot Using NLP

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a **Chatbot** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The chatbot is designed to understand simple user inputs and respond based on predefined intents such as greetings, weather-related queries, and jokes. The project is developed using **Python**, **Flask**, **NLTK**, and **Spacy** for NLP tasks.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used for the chatbot.
- **Flask**: Web framework used for building the web interface.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text preprocessing and basic NLP tasks (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
- **Spacy**: For advanced NLP tasks like part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the chatbot web interface styling.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: The chatbot preprocesses user inputs using techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Simple Intent Matching**: The chatbot matches user input to predefined intents (greeting, weather queries, jokes) and responds accordingly.
- **Flask Web Interface**: A simple Flask application provides a user interface for interacting with the chatbot.
- **Response Generation**: The chatbot generates predefined responses for different intents like greetings, jokes, and weather queries.
